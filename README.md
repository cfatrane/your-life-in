# Boilerplate React + TypeScript + Vite WIP

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

- [**Husky** üê∂](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) : Automatically lint your commit messages, code, and run tests upon committing or pushing.
- [**ESlint**](https://eslint.org/) : Statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.
- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/) : An opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
- [**Tailwind**](https://tailwindcss.com/) : A utility-first CSS framework that streamlines web development by providing a set of pre-designed utility classes.
- [**VSCode**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) : Configuration file and recommended extensions

## VSCode Extensions üíª

### [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)

The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.
With this extension, you will be able to categorise your annotations into:

- Alerts
- Queries
- TODOs
- Highlights
- Commented out code can also be styled to make it clear the code shouldn't be there
- Any other comment styles you'd like can be specified in the settings

### [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

Tailwind CSS IntelliSense enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing Visual Studio Code users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

### [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

Integrates ESLint into VS Code. If you are new to ESLint check the documentation.

The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a local install or `npm install -g eslint` for a global install.

On new folders you might also need to create an .eslintrc configuration file. You can do this by either using the VS Code command Create ESLint configuration or by running the eslint command in a terminal with `npx eslint --init`.

### [SonarLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally)

SonarLint by Sonar is a free IDE extension that empowers you to fix coding issues before they exist. More than a linter, SonarLint detects and highlights issues that can lead to bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells as you create your code. It offers clear remediation guidance and educational help, so you can fix issues before the code is committed. SonarLint in VS Code supports analysis of JS/TS, Python, PHP, Java, C, C++, C#, Go, and IaC code locally in your IDE.

### [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens)

ErrorLens turbo-charges language diagnostic features by making diagnostics stand out more prominently, highlighting the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated by the language and also prints the message inline.

<!-- This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
};
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list -->
